# INKAR Corridor Variable Review and PCA Note

Created: `2026-03-19 12:09:54`

## 1. Why this note exists

This note does two things at once:
- it prepares a concrete answer to the supervisor email about potentially counterintuitive INKAR variables;
- it documents a cleaner decision path from the old exploratory wide PCA towards a curated, literature-guided vulnerability PCA for the EFAS corridor sample.

## 2. Main conclusion

- A wide PCA with many variables is still useful as an exploratory diagnostic tool.
- It should not automatically be the final vulnerability index if the variable set contains compositional counterparts, nested age blocks, duplicated access measures, or variables with counterintuitive definitions.
- The original 51-variable set was a broad exploratory screening set. It was not yet fully cleaned with respect to definition conflicts and duplicated constructs.
- For the final thesis, the stronger strategy is: keep the old wide PCA as an exploratory/sensitivity result, but build the main interpretable index from a curated set of variables with clear theoretical roles.

## 3. Direct answer to the email concern

- In the current corridor raw-INKAR build, `a_ALGII_SGBII` and `a_Unterkunft_SGBII` have `825` complete municipality pairs and a correlation of `-0.703`.
- That is a strong negative relationship, but it is not a perfect `-1.0` complement relationship in the current corridor data.
- So the safe interpretation is: they are conceptually overlapping and partly compositional, but they should not be treated as a clean mathematical complement pair without checking the exact official denominator definitions.
- For PCA interpretation, both variables should not remain together in the final curated index, because they would overweight one SGB-II-related dimension.
- My recommendation is to keep `a_ALGII_SGBII` as the more directly interpretable deprivation signal and to drop `a_Unterkunft_SGBII` from the curated main PCA.

## 4. Corridor full-INKAR layer

- Full original-code corridor layer:
  `/Users/maxi_161/Desktop/UNI/Master/THESIS/Master-Thesis/ANALYSE_FINAL_CORRIDOR/INKAR_FULL_CORRIDOR/outputs/gpkg/corridor_full_inkar_original_codes.gpkg`
- One-row-per-municipality CSV:
  `/Users/maxi_161/Desktop/UNI/Master/THESIS/Master-Thesis/ANALYSE_FINAL_CORRIDOR/INKAR_FULL_CORRIDOR/outputs/tables/corridor_full_inkar_original_codes.csv`
- Corridor municipalities in geometry layer: `835`
- Municipalities with any INKAR row in the latest-build table: `834`
- Original INKAR indicators available in the corridor build: `176`
- One municipality (`16076094`, Berga-Wünschendorf) remains missing in the raw latest-build table.

## 5. What the old 51-variable PCA was actually doing

- The old 51-variable set was a manually assembled, broad exploratory screening set.
- It mixed poverty/welfare, detailed age composition, household structure, income composition, health-care supply, digital infrastructure, accessibility, and density in one block.
- That is useful to let the data show broad covariance structure.
- But it also means that some concepts appear several times, for example:
  - age structure through multiple nested age shares plus dependency ratios;
  - household income through low, medium, and high shares together;
  - health access through both total physicians and specialist-specific sub-indicators;
  - digital access through several broadband thresholds;
  - SGB-II deprivation through several related but definition-sensitive indicators.
- So the old 51-variable PCA is defensible as an exploratory starting point, but not ideal as the final, most interpretable vulnerability index.

## 6. Initial correlation diagnosis

- Original 51-variable correlation heatmap:
  `/Users/maxi_161/Desktop/UNI/Master/THESIS/Master-Thesis/ANALYSE_FINAL_CORRIDOR/INKAR_VARIABLE_REVIEW/outputs/plots/old51_correlation_heatmap.png`
- All-176-variable correlation heatmap:
  `/Users/maxi_161/Desktop/UNI/Master/THESIS/Master-Thesis/ANALYSE_FINAL_CORRIDOR/INKAR_VARIABLE_REVIEW/outputs/plots/all176_correlation_heatmap.png`
- Curated-variable correlation heatmap:
  `/Users/maxi_161/Desktop/UNI/Master/THESIS/Master-Thesis/ANALYSE_FINAL_CORRIDOR/INKAR_VARIABLE_REVIEW/outputs/plots/curated_correlation_heatmap.png`

The correlation step should come first because it makes duplication visible before PCA loadings are interpreted.

Top correlation pairs from the old 51-variable set are saved here:

## 7. PCA comparison

Comparison across model versions:
- `original_51`:  51 variables, 834 municipalities, PC1 variance `16.18%`, cumulative PC1-PC4 `43.40%`, cumulative PC1-PC8 `60.07%`
- `all_176`: 176 variables, 834 municipalities, PC1 variance `15.14%`, cumulative PC1-PC4 `33.01%`, cumulative PC1-PC8 `44.14%`
- `curated`:  17 variables, 834 municipalities, PC1 variance `27.65%`, cumulative PC1-PC4 `63.44%`, cumulative PC1-PC8 `83.15%`

Interpretation:
- The all-176 PCA is useful as a broad structural diagnostic, not as the main final index.
- The original 51-variable PCA is a cleaner exploratory subset than all 176, but it still contains several duplicated constructs.
- The curated PCA sacrifices breadth for interpretability and should be the strongest candidate for the main thesis index.

## 8. Proposed curated variable set for the main vulnerability PCA

These are the proposed core variables for the main interpretable PCA:
- `a_ALGII_SGBII` — ALG II-Leistungen an SGBII | coverage `98.80%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `a_aloLang` — Langzeitarbeitslose | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `q_alo_u25_einw` — Jüngere Arbeitslose | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `a_Minijobs` — Anteil Minijobs an den Beschäftigungsverhältnissen | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `q_kaufkraft` — Kaufkraft | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `q_einkst_bev` — Einkommensteuer | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `a_hheink_niedrig` — Haushalte mit niedrigem Einkommen | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `a_bev65um` — Einwohner 65 Jahre und älter | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `q_abhg_alt` — Abhängigenquote Alte | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `q_HH1` — Einpersonenhaushalte | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `a_hh_kind` — Haushalte mit Kindern | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `m_G02_SUP_DIST` — Entfernung zum Supermarkt/Discounter | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `m_Q01_APO_DIST` — Entfernung zur Apotheke | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `m_Q07_HA_DIST` — Entfernung zum Hausarzt | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `m_OEV20_DIST` — Entfernung zur ÖV Haltestelle | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `q_ärzte_bev` — Ärzte | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.
- `a_bb_100Mbits` — Bandbreitenverfügbarkeit mindestens 100 Mbit/s | coverage `99.88%` | Keep as core candidate in the curated vulnerability PCA.

Why this curated set is stronger:
- it keeps one representative for each main vulnerability mechanism instead of several near-duplicates;
- it avoids explicit definition conflicts like `a_BG1P` and the SGB-II housing-cost share problem;
- it reduces compositional over-weighting from nested age, income, physician, and broadband blocks;
- it stays close to the literature-based logic of deprivation, demographic sensitivity, household/social structure, and accessibility/adaptive capacity.

## 11. Recommended next step

- Keep the original 51-variable PCA as an exploratory comparison / appendix result.
- Use the all-176 PCA only as a diagnostic exercise, not as the main thesis index.
- Build the main vulnerability index from the curated set, then inspect its loadings and signs carefully.
- If needed, we can next turn this directly into a keep/review/drop decision meeting note or a reply draft to the supervisors.
